Malus-game

Hello! Welcome to the code for the first coherent game I've ever built. The
majority of the coding was completed in late 2011 - this being much of the
mechanics and classes. The code was polished in the summer of 2013 and made to
work together properly, resulting in a fully functional game (that has yet to
be properly balanced).

In the future, should I have the time, I hope to add more to the game, namely
some sort of GUI such that the game doesn't input and output to the terminal.

All of the code is in the src directory. Game.java is the main class, so the
command 'java Game' will run it from inside src. Or you could run any of the 
jar files in the main directory.
